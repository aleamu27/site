# 🔧 VERCEL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE FIX

## ❌ Current Issue
Your React app can't access environment variables because they use the wrong naming convention.

## ✅ Fix Required in Vercel Dashboard

### Step 1: Add the Correct Environment Variable
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
3. **ADD a NEW variable:**
   - **Name:** `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **Value:** (copy the same value from your `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
   - **Environment:** Production (or All Environments)

### Step 2: Deploy with New Variable
1. After adding the variable, trigger a new deployment
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Select "Use existing Build Cache" (unchecked) to force fresh build

### Step 3: Verify Fix
1. Visit your live site
2. Open browser DevTools (F12)
3. Check console for "Supabase Debug:" output
4. Should now show `hasKey: true` and a key length > 0

## 🎯 Why This Fixes It
- React environment variables MUST start with `REACT_APP_`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables work for Next.js, not React
- Your code now looks for the correct variable name

## 🗑️ Cleanup (Optional)
After confirming it works, you can remove the old `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` variable if you're not using it elsewhere.
